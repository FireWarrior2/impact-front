##### Description

The mechanism is needed to provide the Research station with computation. Can work with multi-amp Energy Hatch.

##### General

The quantum computer communicates with the research station via Optical Fiber Cable. In the station the cable is connected to the data receiver (Optical Slave Connector), in the computer to the data transmitter (Optical Master Connector). 1 transmitter can only be connected to 1 receiver. If several quantum computers are to be connected to the station, they can be connected in series by installing receivers in them.

The chips that provide computing and the heat sinks (Vent) that cool them are placed in computer racks (Computer Rack). Depending on the number of racks needed, you can change the length of the computer from 4 to 16 units. Different chips provide different numbers of calculations per second.


When the computer is running, the racks with the chips get hot. If an unbalanced cooling scheme is selected, if the rack heats up s temperature to over 60% of the critical temperature, the chips in the rack will burn out and the rack will begin to cool down.

##### Energy consumption

A quantum computer consumes 524,288 * (1 + n) EU/t,

n - number of racks with chips (empty racks do not consume energy)

##### Structure Features

The units in front of the computer fans (Computer Heat Vent) must be empty.

##### Important!

It is forbidden to dismantle a structure in working order to avoid an explosion!

##### Uncertainty resolving in Uncertainty Resolver

You just need to balance the lights around the focal points in the uncertainty hatch. There are 9 focal points in total, active ones are either green or red, you don't need to balance inactive ones.


If you take a closer look at the LEDs you will notice that they have 2 shades on their surface. Darker color denotes the affected area by the focal point. Only that area needs to be \balanced on top of the focal point\ to satisfy it.


In the example i have highlighted the effect range of 2 focal points.


Buttons on the sides are used to pickup and replace 2 uncertain values.


Uncertainty Resolver X resolves uncertainty automatically.
