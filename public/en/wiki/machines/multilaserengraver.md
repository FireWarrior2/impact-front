### MULTI LASER ENGRAVER

![LOGO](https://gtimpact.space/media/gregtech/ParLaser.png)

##### Description

The machine is analog to Laser Engraver. Can work with multi-amp Energy Hatch and parallelism.

##### General

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog. Modes are switched with a screwdriver. Can work with multiple lenses (schemes) that are in different bases in mode \Buses separated on\ (switched with a screwdriver while holding down the Shift key). Recipe is executed with the shape (circuit) that is in the same bass as the material

##### Parallelism

- Requires Parallel Super Computer


- Requires Communication Tower

The machine has parallelism. Parallelism is the ability to perform the same action simultaneously in multiple threads.


If we consider parallelism in the game, it is the execution of the same recipe type several times in one cycle (the energy consumption is proportional to the number of recipes executed).


The machine allows you to spend Parallel Points (PP). Points are limited to Parallel Receiver: 4, 16, 64, 256.


After installing the communication tower, you must configure the frequency with which the tower, computer and machines will work. It is configured through the laptop, by clicking on the controller.


To transmit PP to the machine, you must install a Parallel Receiver in the machine. Then click on Parallel Receiver on the laptop and Parallel Transmitter on the computer.If the receiver/transmitter lights red, it is a connection error or no connection, if it lights yellow, it is successfully connected.

##### Important!

Doesnt ignore the requirement \Needs Cleanroom\.

##### Structure

The mechanism has geometric dimensions 5x3x5 length, width, height, respectively. The mandatory blocks in addition to the controller are Maintenance Hatch, Energy Hatch. You need 36 Engraver Casing, 10 I-glass (1 white, 3 red, 3 green, 3 blue) to build (not including hatchlings). The colors of the glass are fixed and cannot be changed.
