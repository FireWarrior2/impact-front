##### Description

The mechanism is an alternative to a gas turbine: consuming combustible gas (see gas turbine fuel in NEI) and oxygen, it generates normal or superheated steam and energy. It can work with multi-amp Dynamo Hatch.

##### General

There are 3 types of solid oxide generators, they differ in casing, amount of gas consumed, power output and type of steam (the first one produces regular steam, the next two produce superheated steam).

The generator starts to produce steam only when it reaches 100% efficiency (acceleration in 250 seconds).
