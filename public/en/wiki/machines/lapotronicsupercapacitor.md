Has Energy Detector Cover support. The controller block must be in Normal Universal Storage mode.
##### Structure features
Inside the shell made of special glass (I-Glass), various energy carrier blocks (Energium / Lapotronic / Mysterious Crystal Capacitor) should be located. You can combine different levels of energy. The number of energy carriers must be divisible by 9, i.e. you can not leave empty spaces.

Below (at the base) you can place Energy and Dynamo Hatch of different levels.
