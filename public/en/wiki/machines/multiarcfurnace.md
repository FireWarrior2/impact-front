![LOGO](https://gtimpact.space/media/gregtech/ParArc.png)

##### Description

The machine is analog to Arc Furnace, Alloy Smelter and Drying Oven. Can work with multi-amp Energy Hatch and parallelism.

##### General

It has three operating modes. Modes are switched with a screwdriver. Can work with multiple circuits in different bass modes \Buses separated on\ (switched with a screwdriver while holding down the Shift key). Recipe is made with the circuitry that is in the same bass as the material.

##### Parallelism

- Requires Parallel Super Computer


- Requires Communication Tower


The machine has parallelism. Parallelism is the ability to perform the same action simultaneously in multiple threads.


If we consider parallelism in the game, it is the execution of the same recipe type several times in one cycle (the energy consumption is proportional to the number of recipes executed).

The machine allows you to spend Parallel Points (PP). Points are limited to Parallel Receiver: 4, 16, 64, 256.


After installing the communication tower, you must configure the frequency with which the tower, computer and machines will work. It is configured through the laptop, by clicking on the controller

To transmit PP to the machine, you must install a Parallel Receiver in the machine. Then click on Parallel Receiver on the laptop and Parallel Transmitter on the computer.


If the receiver/transmitter lights red, it is a connection error or no connection, if it lights yellow, it is successfully connected.

##### Mode 1. Arc Furnace

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 2. Alloy Smelter

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 3. Drying Oven

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.
