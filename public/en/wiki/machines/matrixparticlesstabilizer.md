![LOGO](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/916393114166525974/916670176190169138/MATRIXSTABILIZER.png)
##### Description
The unstable particle beam from the Parametric Diffuser should enter the I-Glass on the left, the stable particle beam for the Matrix Particles Containment comes out on the right.
##### General
The machine is needed to stabilize the beam of unstable matrix particles.
The distance to the Parametric Diffuser and Matrix Particles Stabilizer should not exceed 30 blocks.

Can accumulate up to 100 thousand stable particles. Produces 1 thousand particles per second.

Beams and lightning do no damage.
Constant consumption of 1,920 EU/t electricity.
##### Structure features
The color of the I-Glass in the structure does not matter. Requires low gravity.
