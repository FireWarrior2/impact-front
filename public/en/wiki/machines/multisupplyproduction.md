##### Description

The machine is analog to Autoclave, Dust Washer, Ore Washing Plant and Chemical Bath. Can work with multi-amp Energy Hatch and parallelism.

##### General

It has four operating modes. Modes are switched with a screwdriver.

##### Parallelism

- Requires Parallel Super Computer


- Requires Communication Tower


The machine has parallelism. Parallelism is the ability to perform the same action simultaneously in multiple threads.


If we consider parallelism in the game, it is the execution of the same recipe type several times in one cycle (the energy consumption is proportional to the number of recipes executed).

The machine allows you to spend Parallel Points (PP). Points are limited to Parallel Receiver: 4, 16, 64, 256.


After installing the communication tower, you must configure the frequency with which the tower, computer and machines will work. It is configured through the laptop, by clicking on the controller

To transmit PP to the machine, you must install a Parallel Receiver in the machine. Then click on Parallel Receiver on the laptop and Parallel Transmitter on the computer.


If the receiver/transmitter lights red, it is a connection error or no connection, if it lights yellow, it is successfully connected.

##### Mode 1. Autoclave

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 2. Dust Washer

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 3. Ore Washer

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 4. Chemical Bath

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Structure features

The color of the I-Glass in the structure does not matter.
