##### Description

The machine fills special containers with stable matrix particles. Requires low gravity.

##### General

The stable particle beam from Matrix Particles Stabilizer should enter the I-Glass on the left.

The distance to the Matrix Particles Stabilizer should not exceed 30 blocks.


Can accumulate up to 100,000 of stable particles. Fills Empty Portable Cells with Matrix Particles, each containing 1,000 particles.


Beam does no damage.

Constantly consumpes 1,920 EU/t electricity.

##### Structure features

The color of the I-Glass in the structure does not matter.
