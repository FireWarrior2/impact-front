### Multi Assembling Machine

![LOGO](https://gtimpact.space/media/gregtech/ParAssembler.png)

##### Description

The machine is analog to Assembler, Circuit Assembler, Component Assembler. Can work with multi-amp Energy Hatch and parallelism.

##### General

It has three operating modes. Modes are switched with a screwdriver.

Can work with a lot of programmed circuits that are in different Input Buses in 'Bus separated on' mode (switched with a screwdriver while holding down the Shift key). The recipe is executed with the circuit that is in the same Input Bus as the materials.

##### Parallelism

- Requires Parallel Super Computer


- Requires Communication Tower

The machine has parallelism. Parallelism is the ability to perform the same action simultaneously in multiple threads.


If we consider parallelism in the game, it is the execution of the same recipe type several times in one cycle (the energy consumption is proportional to the number of recipes executed).


The machine allows you to spend Parallel Points (PP). Points are limited to Parallel Receiver: 4, 16, 64, 256.


After installing the communication tower, you must configure the frequency with which the tower, computer and machines will work. It is configured through the laptop, by clicking on the controller


To transmit PP to the machine, you must install a Parallel Receiver in the machine. Then click on Parallel Receiver on the laptop and Parallel Transmitter on the computer.If the receiver/transmitter lights red, it is a connection error or no connection, if it lights yellow, it is successfully connected.

##### Important!

Doesnt ignore the requirement \Needs Cleanroom\.

##### Mode 1. Assembler

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 2. Circuit Assembler

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 3. Component Assembler

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Structure

The mechanism has geometric dimensions 3x9x3 length, width, height, respectively. The mandatory blocks in addition to the controller are Maintenance Hatch, Energy Hatch. Thus, without taking into account the intut, output basses, Parallel Receiver to build a 59 Assembler Casing, 9 I-Glass of any color.
