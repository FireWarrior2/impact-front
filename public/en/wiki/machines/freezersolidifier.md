![LOGO](https://gtimpact.space/media/gregtech/ParFrezSolid.png)
##### Description
During operation, the chiller consumes refrigerant (IC2 Coolant).
##### General
The machine is needed to cool alloys obtained in liquid form in a blast furnace smelter into ingots (Blast Smelter). Can work with multi-amp Energy Hatch and parallelism.
##### Parallelism
- Requires Parallel Super Computer

- Requires Communication Tower

The machine has parallelism. Parallelism is the ability to perform the same action simultaneously in multiple threads.

If we consider parallelism in the game, it is the execution of the same recipe type several times in one cycle (the energy consumption is proportional to the number of recipes executed).
The machine allows you to spend Parallel Points (PP). Points are limited to Parallel Receiver: 4, 16, 64, 256.

After installing the communication tower, you must configure the frequency with which the tower, computer and machines will work. It is configured through the laptop, by clicking on the controller
To transmit PP to the machine, you must install a Parallel Receiver in the machine. Then click on Parallel Receiver on the laptop and Parallel Transmitter on the computer.

If the receiver/transmitter lights red, it is a connection error or no connection, if it lights yellow, it is successfully connected.
