##### Description

The mechanism is an improved version of the large steam turbines.

##### General

The huge turbine consumes all the steam that enters it and converts it into energy: 2 l/tick of normal steam or 1 l/tick of superheated steam are converted into 1 eU/t of electricity.

The turbine does not require a rotor in the controller.

The turbine does not explode if more steam comes in than the Dynamo Hatch can produce as energy.

Breakdowns greatly reduce the efficiency of the turbine.
