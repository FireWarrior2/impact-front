##### Description
Blast Smelter can work with a lot of program schemes that are in different Input Bus. The recipe is executed with the circuit that is in the same Input Bus as the materials.
##### General
The mechanism makes it possible to produce alloys in liquid form from a multitude of solid components at the input. Can work with multi-amp Energy Hatch.
The blast furnace also has mechanics similar to those of the Electric Blast Furnace:

1. Every 900 K of coil temperature above the minimum required for the operation reduces power consumption by 5%.

2. Every 1800 K coil temperature above the minimum required for the operation allows you to raise the level of Energy Hatch required without losing efficiency (time is reduced by a factor of 4).

3. Increasing the Energy Hatch level, starting with HV, increases the coil temperature of the blast furnace alloyer by 100 K. That is, dT = 100 * (Tier - 2).
##### Structure Features
It has 24 heating coils (Heating Coil), the same as those used in the electric blast furnace. It is not possible to combine different coils.
