##### Description

The machine is analog to Extruder, Bender Ð¸ Forming Press. Can work with multi-amp Energy Hatch and parallelism.

##### General

It has three operating modes. Modes are switched with a screwdriver. 

Can work with a lot of programmed circuits that are in different Input Buses in 'Bus separated on' mode (switched with a screwdriver while holding down the Shift key). The recipe is executed with the circuit that is in the same Input Bus as the materials.

##### Parallelism

- Requires Parallel Super Computer


- Requires Communication Tower

The machine has parallelism. Parallelism is the ability to perform the same action simultaneously in multiple threads.


If we consider parallelism in the game, it is the execution of the same recipe type several times in one cycle (the energy consumption is proportional to the number of recipes executed).


The machine allows you to spend Parallel Points (PP). Points are limited to Parallel Receiver: 4, 16, 64, 256.


After installing the communication tower, you must configure the frequency with which the tower, computer and machines will work. It is configured through the laptop, by clicking on the controller


To transmit PP to the machine, you must install a Parallel Receiver in the machine. Then click on Parallel Receiver on the laptop and Parallel Transmitter on the computer.If the receiver/transmitter lights red, it is a connection error or no connection, if it lights yellow, it is successfully connected.

##### Mode 1. Extruder

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 2. Bender

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

##### Mode 3. Forming Press

Performs all the recipes of the singleblock analog.

Can automatically rename items with Mold (Name) renamed to that name, that will be given to the item (the shape can be renamed with Tool Forge without consuming a level). Works only if the bass with this form is not more than 1 stack of items.

##### Structure

The mechanism has geometric dimensions 5x3x3 length, width, height, respectively. The Muffler Hatch, Maintenance Hatch, and Energy Hatch are mandatory blocks in addition to the controller. Thus, without taking into account the intut, output basses, Parallel Receiver, you need 41 PBE Casing building blocks.
