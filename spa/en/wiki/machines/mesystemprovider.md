##### Description

The machine produces ME components by consuming matrix particles and also accelerates the ME itself.

##### General

By consuming matrix particles, performs recipes, which can be seen in the NEI.

Matrix Particles are unloaded into the machine from the Full Portable Cell with Matrix Particles in the Matrix Particles Chamber.

Can accumulate up to 100,000 matrix particles.


Additionally, without consuming energy or particles to do so, it accelerates the Crafting Co-Processing Units inside itself, i.e. they start working for several co-processors. The degree of acceleration depends on the tier of the Crafting Storage inside: for 4k storage it is x2 (4 coprocessors start working as 8), for 16k - x3, for 64k- x4. When combining storages of different tiers, acceleration is counted for the lowest level. EC2 creation storages do not accelerate co-processors, but can be used.

Connects to the ME network via the ME Connector. It consumes 2 channels.

##### Structure features

The color of the I-Glass in the structure does not matter.
